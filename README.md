# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. 
Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, featuring a series of 25 daily programming challenges. 
The puzzles vary in difficulty and can be solved using any programming language.
